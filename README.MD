## Features

- Custom Orders (buttons in buy order and insta buy menu so you can have options for different buy amounts)
- Insta Sell Rules (make rules to lock insta sell button until clicked 3x)
- Flip Helper (makes button in flip gui to flip for market price instead of having to find and type it into sign)
- Outdated Item Notifications (tells you in chat when an order has been undercut, click message to open bazaar if you have a cookie)
- Stash Helper (keybind (default alt + v) to close guis if applicable and pick up stash)

## Using Bazaar Utils

##### To open the mod config use `/bazaarutils` or `/bu`.
Other commands:
- customorder add {order amount} {slot number} _(top left slot is slot #1, to the right is #2, etc etc)_
- customorder remove {order number} _(the order it is shown in config)_
- rule add {based on volume or price} {amount over which will be restricted}
- rule remove {rule number}
- developer _(to enable developer settings, you probably wont use this)_

### Future Features

- Option to disable pick up stash messages/control frequency of them
